                <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
                <p><em>Last updated: February 14, 2026</em></p>

                <h3>Our Relationship with Brands</h3>
                <p>PetBizos operates as an affiliate marketing platform. This means we have affiliate relationships with the brands featured on our website. When you click an "Activate Cashback" button and make a purchase, we may earn a commission from that brand.</p>

                <h3>How We Make Money</h3>
                <p>PetBizos earns money through affiliate commissions paid by our partner brands. When you complete a purchase after activating cashback through our platform, the brand pays us a commission. We share a portion of this commission with you as cashback, and we keep a portion to operate and maintain our service.</p>

                <h3>Your Cost</h3>
                <p>Using PetBizos is completely free for you. You pay the exact same price as if you went directly to the brand's website. The commission we earn comes from the brand, not from you, and does not increase the price you pay.</p>

                <h3>Our Recommendations</h3>
                <p>We only partner with brands that we believe offer quality products for dogs. However, our affiliate relationships may influence which brands we feature and promote. We strive to provide honest information and to clearly disclose when we have an affiliate relationship.</p>

                <h3>Editorial Independence</h3>
                <p>While we earn commissions from our partner brands, we maintain editorial independence in how we present information. Our goal is to help you find the best products for your dog while earning cashback.</p>

                <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>
                <p>Our website contains links to partner brand websites. When you click these links and make a purchase, we may earn a commission. These are affiliate links, and they help us provide this service to you at no cost.</p>

                <h3>FTC Compliance</h3>
                <p>This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."</p>

                <h3>Product Reviews and Information</h3>
                <p>Any product information, reviews, or descriptions on our website are based on publicly available information from the brands. We encourage you to conduct your own research and read reviews from multiple sources before making a purchase decision.</p>

                <h3>Changes to This Disclosure</h3>
                <p>We may update this affiliate disclosure from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
