                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Is PetBizos free to use?</h3>
                <p>Yes! PetBizos is completely free. You never pay extra for using our service. We earn a commission from our partner brands when you make a purchase, and we share a portion of that commission with you as cashback.</p>

                <h3>How much cashback can I earn?</h3>
                <p>Cashback rates vary by brand and can range from 5% to 15% or more. Each brand and deal page shows the current cashback rate. Some brands also offer special promotions with higher cashback rates.</p>

                <h3>When will I receive my cashback?</h3>
                <p>Cashback typically appears in your account within 30-60 days after your purchase. This waiting period allows time for returns and ensures the transaction is completed.</p>

                <h3>How do I get paid?</h3>
                <p>Once your cashback is confirmed, you can request payment via PayPal, bank transfer, or gift card, depending on your preference and available options.</p>

                <h3>What if I return a product?</h3>
                <p>If you return a product to the brand, the cashback for that purchase will be deducted from your PetBizos account. This is why there's a waiting period before cashback is confirmed.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to do anything special to track my purchase?</h3>
                <p>No special action is required! Just make sure to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the "Activate Cashback" button before shopping</li>
                    <li>Complete your purchase in the same browser session</li>
                    <li>Don't use ad blockers or private browsing mode</li>
                    <li>Complete your purchase within 24 hours of clicking the button</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Can I use coupons or promo codes?</h3>
                <p>Yes! In most cases, you can use coupons and promo codes in addition to earning cashback. However, some brands may have restrictions on combining cashback with certain offers. Check the brand's specific terms on their page.</p>

                <h3>Does using PetBizos cost me anything extra?</h3>
                <p>No. You pay the exact same price as if you went directly to the brand's website. The only difference is that you earn cashback on your purchase.</p>
