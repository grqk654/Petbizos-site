                <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
                <p><em>Last updated: February 14, 2026</em></p>

                <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                <p>By accessing and using PetBizos ("the Service"), you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of this agreement. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, please do not use the Service.</p>

                <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
                <p>PetBizos is a cashback platform that allows users to earn cashback on purchases made at partner brand websites. When you click an "Activate Cashback" button and complete a purchase, we track that purchase and credit cashback to your account.</p>

                <h3>3. User Accounts</h3>
                <p>To use certain features of the Service, you may be required to create an account. You agree to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate and complete information</li>
                    <li>Maintain the security of your account credentials</li>
                    <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access</li>
                    <li>Be responsible for all activities that occur under your account</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Cashback Program</h3>
                
                <h4>4.1 Earning Cashback</h4>
                <p>To earn cashback, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the "Activate Cashback" button before making a purchase</li>
                    <li>Complete your purchase in the same browser session</li>
                    <li>Have cookies and JavaScript enabled</li>
                    <li>Complete the purchase within 24 hours of clicking the button</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4.2 Cashback Rates</h4>
                <p>Cashback rates are displayed on our website and may change at any time without notice. The rate in effect at the time you activate cashback will apply to your purchase, subject to the brand's terms.</p>

                <h4>4.3 Pending and Confirmed Cashback</h4>
                <p>Cashback will appear as "pending" until the return period has passed and the purchase is confirmed. This typically takes 30-60 days. Pending cashback may be adjusted or removed if the purchase is returned or cancelled.</p>

                <h4>4.4 Payment</h4>
                <p>You may request payment of confirmed cashback through available payment methods. Minimum payout thresholds may apply. We reserve the right to withhold payment if we suspect fraud or violation of these terms.</p>
